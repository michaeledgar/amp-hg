      # repository data with a bundle file. The bundle file contains un-merged-in
      # changesets - this is useful for, say, previewing the results of a pull
      # action.

      # A bundle is stored in the following manner:
      #  - Changelog entries
      #  - Manifest  entries
      #  - Modified File entry #1
      #  - Modified File entry #2
